A website I wrote while learning MERN stack/programming in early 2020. 
The user can upload information about public restrooms, which can then be accessed by other users using the search function. 
The website isn't deployed, however,  I plan to do so sometime in the not too distant future. At a glance, error handling and code maintainability need to be improved before the website is deployable. 
The project doesn't reflect my current abilities as a programmer, but it was a fun challenge that taught me a lot about the MERN stack in practice.
